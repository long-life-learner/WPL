          The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal
          zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious match
          against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It's too easy.
          You'll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professional tennis
          player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quickly lose
          motivation because the match is too difficult.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now consider playing tennis against someone who is your equal. As the
          game progresses, you win a few points and you lose a few. You have a
          good chance of winning, but only if you really try. Your focus
          narrows, distractions fade away, and you find yourself fully invested
          in the task at hand. This is a challenge of just manageable difficulty
          and it is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when
          working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current
          abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.
        </p>

        <p>
          Martin’s comedy career is an excellent example of the Goldilocks Rule
          in practice. Each year, he expanded his comedy routine—but only by a
          minute or two. He was always adding new material, but he also kept a
          few jokes that were guaranteed to get laughs. There were just enough
          victories to keep him motivated and just enough mistakes to keep him
          working hard.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we want to break down the mystery of how to stay motivated for the
          long-term, we could simply say:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Stick to The Goldilocks Rule and work on tasks of just manageable
          difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Measure your progress and receive immediate feedback whenever
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wanting to improve your life is easy. Sticking with it is a different
          story. If you want to stay motivated for good, then start with a
          challenge that is just manageable, measure your progress, and repeat
          the process.
